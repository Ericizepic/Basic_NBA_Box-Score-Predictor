# basic-nba-outcome-predictor


A sequential machine-learning model made with TensorFlow and Keras to predict the outcome of games based solely on boxscore information about the home team. This includes home/away as well as standard stats like pts/asts/reb as well as averages and shooting percentages. Able to predict with ~54% accuracy which is better than guessing.

Meant only to be a fun exercise. Clearly one needs to take into account the opponent. Originally planned to predict the results of matches based on the W/L of both teams as well as their season averages. However, this data was not readily available.
